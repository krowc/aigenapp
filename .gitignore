## 2025-10-30 — Prepared .gitignore update and created LOG.md (proposed)
- Author: Assistant (prepared content for user)
- Summary:
  - Prepared an expanded `.gitignore` to ignore common Node/Expo/React Native build artifacts, caches, environment files, IDE files, signing keys, and OS-specific temporary files.
  - Created this `LOG.md` file to serve as a single chronological record of debugging activity, configuration changes, and approved patches.
- Notes:
  - The `.gitignore` contents were prepared and provided to the user. Please commit the `.gitignore` and this `LOG.md` to the repository when you are ready.
  - This entry is marked as "prepared" to indicate the change has been authored in content and awaits your commit/approval to be applied to the repo history.

## 2025-10-28 — Debugging Session Summary
- Source: `DEBUG_SESSION.md` (imported into the log for historical traceability)
- Summary of issues observed:
  1. App crashed in Expo Go with an error:
     - "Uncaught Error: java.io.IOException: Failed to download remote update"
     - The app worked on web but failed on an Android device.
  2. Missing navigation header on Android:
     - Blue "My Profile" header visible on web but not on the native Android device.
- Actions taken / solutions implemented:
  1. Remote Update Crash Fix
     - Root cause: Expo Go attempting to download OTA updates during development; network/device couldn't fetch the update, causing an IO exception.
     - Solution: Disabled updates in `app.json`:
       ```
       {
         "expo": {
           "updates": {
             "enabled": false,
             "fallbackToCacheTimeout": 0
           }
         }
       }
       ```
     - Additional step: Recommend starting Expo in Tunnel mode for reliable device connection:
       ```
       npx expo start --tunnel --clear
       ```
  2. Navigation Dependencies
     - Installed required native navigation packages to support native behavior:
       ```
       npx expo install react-native-screens react-native-gesture-handler
       ```
  3. Debugging Process
     - Isolated app components:
       - Temporarily rendered `ProfileScreen` directly (bypassing navigation) and confirmed the UI component worked in isolation.
       - The issue was narrowed to navigation/native integration when direct rendering succeeded.
     - Restored navigation setup:
       - Reverted `App.tsx` to use `AppNavigator` after ensuring native dependencies were installed.
- Pending improvements / follow-up:
  1. Navigation header fix:
     - Initialize gesture handler at app entry (top of `App.tsx`):
       ```ts
       import 'react-native-gesture-handler';
       ```
     - Optionally enable native screens optimizations:
       ```ts
       import { enableScreens } from 'react-native-screens';
       enableScreens();
       ```
  2. Development tips:
     - Use Tunnel mode when LAN discovery is unreliable.
     - Keep `updates.enabled = false` in development if OTA update fetching fails on device.
     - Ensure React Navigation native dependencies are installed for native platforms.
  3. Platform differences:
     - Web may display navigation elements without native initialization; native platforms require native package setup and entry-point imports.

- Files referenced as modified during the debugging session:
  - `app.json`: Updates configuration added to disable OTA updates during development.
  - `App.tsx`: Temporarily altered during isolation testing; later restored to mount `AppNavigator`.
  - `package.json`: Navigation dependencies added via `npx expo install`.

- Helpful commands from the debugging session:
  ```
  # Start with tunnel and clear caches
  npx expo start --tunnel --clear

  # Install navigation dependencies
  npx expo install react-native-screens react-native-gesture-handler
  ```

## Notes on process and governance
- This `LOG.md` is a living artifact: every approved and applied change (bugfixes, config changes, file edits) should be appended here with the date, author, summary of changes, and any referenced commands or files modified.
- Recommended format for future entries:
  - Date — Short title
  - Author
  - Summary of change
  - Files changed (paths)
  - Commands and notes
  - Verification steps

---

## How to use this file
- When you approve a change prepared by me (or any contributor), append an entry here indicating:
  - That you approved and committed the change,
  - The commit hash (if available),
  - Any verification steps performed (e.g., "Verified on Android device with Expo Go" or "Ran `npx expo start --tunnel --clear` and confirmed navigation header appears").
- Keep entries concise but actionable. This file should help future debugging and onboarding by preserving the "why" behind changes.
